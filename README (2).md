## Design Process

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

The **Low-Fidelity Wireframes** provide a basic layout and structure, focusing on user flow and interface components. These were used to map out core functionalities and establish a cohesive user journey.

**Key Screens**:
- Dashboard (with quick links to key sections)
- staff List and Profile
- Appointment Scheduling
- Notifications and Messages


### High-Fidelity Prototypes

The **High-Fidelity Prototypes** offer a polished design with colors, typography, icons, and detailed components. They incorporate the hospitalâ€™s brand colors and follow a clean, professional aesthetic to provide a more realistic user experience.

**Key Improvements from Low-Fi**:
- Added brand-specific colors and fonts for improved readability.
- Created interactive elements like buttons and menus to simulate the final app experience.
- Ensured accessibility with contrasting colors and a clear visual hierarchy.
