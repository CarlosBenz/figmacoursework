## Project Overview

This project is focused on designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for a hospital app that supports:
- **Patient Management**: Tracking patient information, appointments, and medical records.
- **Staff Scheduling**: Scheduling shifts for doctors, nurses, and administrative staff.
- **Appointment Booking**: Allowing patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
- **Messaging**: Secure messaging between doctors, patients, and hospital staff.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and sign-up pages for both patients and staff.
- **Dashboard**: A unified view of all activities and alerts for easy navigation.
- **Medical Records**: Comprehensive access to patient histories, diagnoses, and treatments.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Simplified scheduling flow to improve the patient experience.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for upcoming appointments, medication reminders, and updates.

## Design Process

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

The **Low-Fidelity Wireframes** provide a basic layout and structure, focusing on user flow and interface components. These were used to map out core functionalities and establish a cohesive user journey.

**Key Screens**:
- Login and Registration
- Dashboard (with quick links to key sections)
- Patient List and Profile
- Appointment Scheduling
- Notifications and Messages

### High-Fidelity Prototypes

The **High-Fidelity Prototypes** offer a polished design with colors, typography, icons, and detailed components. They incorporate the hospitalâ€™s brand colors and follow a clean, professional aesthetic to provide a more realistic user experience.

**Key Improvements from Low-Fi**:
- Added brand-specific colors and fonts for improved readability.
- Created interactive elements like buttons and menus to simulate the final app experience.
- Ensured accessibility with contrasting colors and a clear visual hierarchy.
